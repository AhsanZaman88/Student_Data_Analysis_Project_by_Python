# Student_Data_Analysis_Project_by_Python
This project analyzes the factors that affect students' academic performance using Python and its libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset includes information on gender distribution, parental education levels, parental marital status, sports practice frequency, test preparation completion, and weekly study hours.

Key Findings:

--Gender Distribution--
The dataset contains nearly equal numbers of female (15,424) and male (15,217) students, ensuring balanced representation.

--Parental Education Effect--
Students with parents holding a master's or bachelor's degree tend to score higher (mid-70s) in Math, Reading, and Writing.
Students with parents having "some high school" or "high school" education tend to score lower (low 60s to high 60s).
Higher parental education levels correlate with better student performance across subjects.

--Parental Marital Status Effect--
Parental marital status shows minimal effect on students' academic scores, indicating it is not a significant factor.

--Sports Practice Effect--
Students who practice sports regularly score the highest across all subjects, followed by those who practice sometimes.
Students who never practice sports have the lowest scores, suggesting a positive impact of regular sports practice on academic performance.

--Test Preparation Effect--
Students who completed test preparation scored significantly higher in Math (70), Reading (74), and Writing (75) compared to those who did not complete test preparation (65, 67, 65 respectively).Completing test preparation is crucial for better academic outcomes.

--Weekly Study Hours Effect--
Students who study 5-10 hours or more than 10 hours per week tend to perform better academically.
Those studying fewer than 5 hours per week have lower marks, showing a positive correlation between study hours and academic performance.
